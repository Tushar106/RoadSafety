### A Brief of the Prototype:

This section must include UML Diagrams and prototype description
_Description_:
The RoadSafety Web Application Prototype aims to enhance road safety and improve traffic management by allowing users to report road blockages, faults, and other issues in real-time. This application utilizes the Google Maps API to provide a user-friendly interface for reporting and viewing road incidents. It promotes community engagement and enables efficient incident reporting.
_Key Features_:

1. _Real-Time Incident Reporting_: Users can report road incidents such as potholes, accidents, roadblocks, and other issues through the application. The location and details of the incident are captured through Google Maps Api.

2. _Interactive Map Interface_: The application integrates Google Maps to provide a familiar and intuitive map interface. Users can easily pinpoint the location of incidents and view the map interactively.

3. _Custom Markers_: Users can mark incidents on the map using custom markers, making it easy to identify the type and location of each incident.

4. _Community Engagement_: The platform encourages community engagement by allowing users to contribute to road safety. It fosters a sense of responsibility and collaboration among users.

5. _Route Planning_: Users can plan routes, view traffic conditions, and receive real-time traffic updates to ensure safe and efficient travel.
